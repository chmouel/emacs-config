This is a collection of (X)Emacs modes for use with Groovy-related technology -- Groovy, Grails, etc.

The Groovy mode is a derived mode of Java mode which is itself a derived mode in CC Mode. Inspiration came
from Dylan R.E. Moonfire's C# mode.

This software is licenced using GNU General Public Licence version 2.

The master of all the material is the Bazaar branch lp:groovy-emacs-mode.  This branch is mirrored in the
Groovy Subversion repository at https://svn.codehaus.org/groovy/trunk/groovy/ide/emacs.

Bazaar is used for development -- the directory in Subversion holds a Bazaar branch so that it is a peer to
the feature branches using bzr-svn.  Feature branches are held on Launchpad.
