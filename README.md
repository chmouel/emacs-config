* This is my personal Emacs configuration, an ongoing work that would never end
  started more than 10 years ago.
  
* I would not advise you to take this as is but just digg into them and take whatever you need for your own configuration.

* If you have a file in your ~/.emacs.d/host/$shorthostname.el where shorthostname is the houtput of hostname -s in mac/linux you can put custom stuff and secrets that you don't to share around.

Here it's how it look like currently
